# ðŸ›’ Online Shopping Sales Analysis Project

**Schema Name:** `sales`  
**Difficulty Level:** `Advanced`  
**Database Used:** PostgreSQL / MySQL

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the complete lifecycle of an e-commerce business through SQL. Using a structured relational database consisting of 9 tables, it simulates an Amazon-like sales environment.

Through querying, transformation, and analysis, we aim to draw valuable business insights related to customer behavior, product sales, order management, shipping delays, payment trends, and inventory performance.

## ðŸ›  Database Setup & Design

**Schema:** `sales`  
**Total Tables:** 9

- `product`  
- `orders`  
- `order_item`
